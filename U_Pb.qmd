## MS selection

- precision

- throughput
- type of sample
- volume
- expected age
- budget

## Role of U-Pb in Mass Spec History

SIMS enabled high-n detrital zircons, LA-ICPMS made it cheaper and faster.

## Zircon

- review papers citations (MSA volume has good historical perspective)
- recap of how to do by TIMS and LA-ICPMS and SIMS with references
- The reason we keep TIMSs around.
- Dating young zircons is hard.

## Current limitations and future directions

Specific to instrument development. Ryan's going to break the 10% ionization efficiency barrier soon by TIMS. Caveat for SIMS.
