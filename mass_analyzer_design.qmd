## Electrostatic Analyzers (ESA) {#sec-analyzer-electrostatic}

Why use an ESA instead of a magnet? Before or after magnet? Why is it so often seen on ICPs and less often (or even not at all!) on a TIMS. Reference Coulomb force, a figure of an ion traversing a ESA. 

Advantage is that you can change a voltage quickly (nanoseconds), for instance to deflect a beam.

## Quadrupole Mass Analyzers {#sec-analyzer-quadrupoles}

### Background
Using a combination of static and alternating voltages, quadrupole mass analyzers generate electric fields, rather than magnetic fields, that filter ions based on their mass to charge ratio (m/z). The possibility of using a quadrupole electric field for mass filtering was first proposed in the 1950's by Wolfgang Paul and Helmut Steinwedel, who drew from earlier use of quadrupole magnetic fields for high energy accelerators [@Dawson_1976]. In contrast to sector instruments, quadrupole mass analyzers are considered “dynamic” – to produce a mass spectrum, the strength and/or frequency of their electric fields must be incrementally adjusted throughout the duration of a scan. 

### Mass filtering - how does it work? {#sec-quadrupole-mass-filtering}

Quadrupole mass filters consist of four parallel rods, connected in crosswise pairs. A potential of (U+Vcosωt) is applied to one pair, while a potential of -(U+Vcosωt) is applied to the second pair. Here, Vcosωt represents an alternating RF voltage with an amplitude of V and frequency of ω; U represents a static voltage ("DC offset"). More simply, you could express the potentials as (DC+RF), and -(DC+RF).

Though the voltage applied to each pair of rods oscillates continuously, the DC component can be thought of as the *average* voltage applied to each pair. In general, high m/z ions respond to the average voltage – positive DC voltage repels and thus stabilizes them, negative DC voltage attracts and destabilizes them – while lighter ions are more sensitive to the RF component.

Because the forces acting on ions traveling through the quadrupole are uncoupled in the X, Y, and Z directions, we can think of mass filtering in terms of two separate planes: the XZ-plane, or X-direction, and the YZ-plane, or Y-direction. Note that in the Z-direction (along the length of the quadrupole), the net force acting on ions is zero.

In the X-direction, ion stability is determined by the two rods with positive DC voltage. In this direction, low m/z ions generally follow the RF component of the field, gain energy, and oscillate with increasing amplitude until they collide with the rods. Meanwhile, high m/z ions are pushed toward the Z-axis and stabilized by the positive DC component. This creates a "high-pass" filter in the X-direction that allows only heavier ions to maintain their trajectory. 

In the Y-direction, ion stability is determined by the rods with negative DC voltage. While the negative DC component has a "de-focusing" or destabilizing effect on large ions, the RF component can keep lighter ions on course by periodically correcting their paths. In this direction, the applied electric fields create a "low-pass" filter through which only lighter ions can maintain their trajectory. 

By manipulating the RF and DC components of the field, the high and low-pass filters can be set to resolve individual atomic masses. The following section discusses the impact of RF and DC voltages on ion stability in more detail.  

### Equations of motion and stability diagrams

- Equations of motion depend both on the (a) geometry of the E-field and (b) on time-dependent potentials
- Beginning with a general geometric description of s quadrupole E-field, impose differential form of Gauss’ law (/Laplace eqn), integrate to get a general eqn for potential, move some things around and plug in the time dependent potentials ±(U+Vcosωt)
- Plug potential into equations of motion (using F=ma=Eq), this is almost Mathieu’s eqn
- SUMMARY → we can use the geometry of the electric field within the analyzer and the time dependent potentials on the rods (bc we already know the relationship between E and Φ) to express the force on an ion and thus determine its equation of motion…solving the equation of motion is trickier
- Substitute in a and q → express the potential within the quadrupole as a second order diff eq. that resembles Mathieu eqn
- Not going to solve the mathieu equation here, bc Mathieu already did → link a paper
- And what does “solving” an equation of motion mean anyway?
- Physical implications of bounded vs unbounded solutions to the equation:
   - “Unbounded” = unstable ion trajectory
   - “Bounded” = stable ion trajectory
- Introduce stability diagram of U/V (specific to a particular m/z), and demonstrate how a and q can be used to generalize the stability diagram
- Altering U and V but keeping a/q constant → ions of increasing or decreasing m/z traverse the mass filter, creating a mass spectrum
- what happens if a/q is not kept constant? → alters resolution, ie pushes the a/q line either above the peak or too far down to provide unit mass resolution → question: how does this compare to a U/V plot?


### Operation and typical geometry of instrument


### Advantages

Quadrupoles can be used on their own, linked in series (e.g. triple quadrupole), or combined (either as filters or analyzers) with other mass analyzers. Compared to sector instruments, they are reliable, fast, and relatively inexpensive. However, they generally offer lower throughput and resolving power.


## Time of flight mass analyzer (TOF) {#sec-analyzer-TOF}

Some history. Space applications. Nanoparticle and environmental applications.

Geometries: reflection plates or not.

Notch filters. If you have oxygen, you have to notch it because it overwhelms everything else. 

Simultaneous collection of all ionized species regardless of mass.

Disadvantages: Much less sensitive for low-z species. Lower sensitivity than quadrupole, also more expensive. Advantages: really fast, very small (fits on a benchtop), suited for imaging applications, portable applications, and extraterrestrial applications.
