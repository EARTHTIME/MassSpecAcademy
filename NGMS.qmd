## Gas Extraction and Sample Preparation

In order to measure noble gases, we first need to extract them from some sample material (solid, liquid, or gas) and, to the best of our ability, isolate the noble gas element we are interested in measuring from all of the other extracted gases. Because of this, essentially all noble gas mass spectrometer (NGMS) systems have what we call an extraction line in front of the ion source. This extraction line will look different in detail in every NGMS laboratory, but it will generally consist of a network of volumes (e.g., tubes, bellows, cans) that are interconnected to one another via valves that enable different volumes to be isolated from one another. Internally, this network of volumes and valves will be comprised entirely of metal that can be heated or "baked" to relatively high temperatures (ie., hundreds of degrees C). This "baking" processes facilitates the release adsorbed gases from the internal components so they can be pumped  away, enabling the NGMS extraction systems to achieve ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions with minimal contributions from gases that are not derived from the samples themselves. Below, we describe how gases are extracted and then processed within this UHV extraction system before being let into the NGMS itself.

For solid samples, gas extraction is most often achieved by heating a sample up under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Heating methods have evolved over time. Early on, heating was most often carried out by dropping samples into a resistance furnace. Today, many laboratories heat samples using what is sometimes called a "laser microfurnace": a sample is placed inside an UHV chamber with some form of transparent window, and the sample is heated through the window using a laser. The type of window, type of laser, and sample-laser coupling is highly application specific and will be discussed later. 

In addition to heating, there are some niche gas extraction methods from solid samples; for example, the noble gas laboratory at ETH Zurich has a gold metal extraction line that enables them to dissolve silicate minerals in the UHV with hydrofluoric acid. However, the dominant technique is still heating.

Once gases have been extracted from a sample material, the noble gas analyst faces a challenge: they have extracted **all** the gases that will be released by the extraction method they chose, not just the noble gas element they are interested in or even just the noble gases. The presence of lots of other gases can negatively impact the measurement of the noble gas the analyst is interested in measuring (e.g., by reducing instrument sensitivity, creating large isobaric interferences, or inducing signal suppression; link to discussion of these topics below). It is therefore important, before attempting to analyze this gas, to "clean it up" or purify it as much as possible. 

There are two primary ways that extracted gases are cleaned up before being let into an NGMS system. The first way is called gettering. In gettering, the gas is exposed to some type of metal alloy material with a very high surface area that will react with reactive gases like CO${_2}$ and H${_2}$O. Form some NGMS extraction systems, this is the extent of the gas clean up process. For others, gases are also purified or separated cryogenically. Cryogenic separation or cryofocusing broadly refers to the process of getting some portion of the extraction line cold, such that heavier gases you want to remove are focused or "trapped" within the cold portion of the line while lighter gases are not trapped and are able to be expanded into a different part of the extraction line.

In addition to using the extraction line system to clean up the gas we have extracted from a sample, the extraction line system will also often have one or more reservoirs of gas attached to it that can be cleaned up and let into the mass spectrometer in the same fashion. Most often, these reservoirs will be filled with some type of reference gas and will have a pair of valves positioned in front of the reservoir, such that a very small aliquot of the gas inside the much bigger reservoir can be taken and processed through the extraction line for analysis. For some applications, it is only important to know the composition of the gas that is inside the reservoir. For example, in Ar-Ar geochronology, extraction lines will have reservoir filled with air, and most labs will not know precisely how much air is in the reservoir, but they will know that it has the argon isotopic composition of air. For other applications, both the composition and amount of gas in the reservoir must be known accurately. In this latter case, it is also important that the volume of space between the valves in front of the reservoir (often referred to as a pipette volume) is known and precisely calibrated. For example, measurements of radiogenic 4He for (U-Th)/He dating are often made by adding an aliquot of pure 3He from a calibrated reservoir volume, such that the amount of 4He in a sample can be determined by isotope dilution.

## Noble Gas Mass Spectrometer System

### Noble gas ion sources

Noble gas mass spectrometer sources typically use a Nier-type ion source, named after Alfred O. Nier who described the design in a series of publications in the 1930s and 1940s (refs). Nier's design consists of an enclosed ionization region with narrow slits that allow electrons to flow through an ionization region (sometimes "the box") from a hot filament to a Faraday cup ("the electron trap" or just "the trap"). The voltages applied to the filament, the ionization region, and the trap, and a variable number of electrostatic lenses designed to focus the ion beam may be tuned by the user.

#### The electron emitter ("the filament")

The filament is typically a strip or coil of a refractory metal such as rhenium or tungsten, which may also be coated in a rare earth oxide such as yttria to lower the work function (the amount of energy required to liberate an electron). Filaments are consumable items with lifetimes that range from several months to many years in a UHV environment, depending on operating conditions. Electrons are produced with a certain energy relative to the ionization region that is maintained by holding the filament at a negative high voltage relative to the ionization region ("the electron energy").

##### Cathode sources

Newer designs incorporate an indirectly heated cathode that confers several advantages. In the context of a Nier-type ion source on a noble gas mass spectrometer, this arrangement is patented by Isotopx. Like the filaments used in traditional designs, these cathode emitters may be composed of a variety of refractory materials. The cathode is mounted on a separate filament with the sole purpose of heating the cathode. If a non-spherical geometry is chosen for the cathode, emission from the cathode surface will be directional rather than isotropic. Usually it is a flat disk so that 50% of the electrons produced are emitted in a circle directed toward the ionization region and 50% are emitted in the opposite direction. This means that a larger share of the electrons produced may be directed into the ionization region, increasing ionization efficiency and simultaneously reducing backgrounds caused by stray electrons colliding with other surfaces and by operation at high temperatures. Indirectly heated cathodes also tend to have longer lifetimes and more stable emission characteristics, as the heating element and emitting surface are physically distinct. This separation allows the emission temperature to be precisely controlled and kept constant, while the extraction and focusing of electrons from the surface is handled separately by adjusting the voltages on additional ion optical elements. It also allows the cathode to be kept a single fixed voltage ("the electron energy") rather than varying along the length of the filament wire as in the traditional design.

##### Electron focusing lenses

The cathode source lends itself particularly well to the use of additional electrostatic lenses to focus the electron beam. Although this is also possible with a traditional filament, it is not typically done. The advantage of using electrostatic lenses after the electron emitter is that the electron beam may be focused to increase ionization efficiency and to change the physical location and character of the ion beam (usually the goal is to create as many ions as close to the center of the ionization region as possible). The reason that the cathode source lends itself particularly well to this setup is that it already requires the use of an additional voltage to control electron extraction. 

#### The ionization region

Electrons produced by the emitter are guided through the ionization region by a potential drop from the filament to the ionization region and then to a Faraday cup also mounted external to the ionization region ("the electron trap"). The flow of electrons is held constant by using a PID controller to maintain a constant "trap current" by adjusting the heating current of the filament. Modern instruments typically operate at trap currents ranging from 200 to 800 $\mu$A. This usually requires heating currents of 2â€“3 A applied to the filament to produce total emission ranging usually from 2 to 7 times higher than the desired trap current. The ratio of emission current to trap current is determined by the physical design of the ion source, the physical adjustment of the filament position during installation, and the tuning of the ion source.
