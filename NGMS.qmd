# NGMS

Noble gas mass spectrometry

## Overview

* Focus on sector instruments

* Also mention other platforms that are less commonly used to measure NG

## Gas Exraction and Sample Preparation

* Generic processes of cleaning up a sample
    - actual gas extraction
    - valves
        - manual
        - automated
    - gas cleanup
        - gettering
        - cryogenic separation
    - isotope dilution
    - gas standards and how to prepare them
        - depletion
    -volume considerations (& design)

## Noble Gas Mass Spectrometer System

### Noble gas ion sources

Noble gas mass spectrometer sources typically use a Nier-type ion source, named after A.O. Nier who described the design in a series of publications in the 1930s and 1940s (refs).
