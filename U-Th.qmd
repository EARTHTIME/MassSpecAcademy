# U-Th

## Applications {#sec-UTh-Applications}

Very brief list of different applications of U-Th dating - carbonates, volcanics, etc.

## History {#sec-UTh-History}

Alpha-counting 1950s; TIMS 1980s; ICP-MS 1990s incl. Q-MS, ICP-SF-MS, MC-ICP-MS; LA-ICP-MS 2000s?

Permil level precision w TIMS and ICP-MS; epsilon-level precision with Faraday cup protocols using larger samples and different resistors

## Challenges {#sec-UTh-Challenges}

Simultaneous measurement of multiple isotopes with a combination of very high and low abundance; peak-tailing from 238U and also from 232Th for samples with 'high' 232; quantifying fractionation; standards

## Instrumentation Choice and Analytical Approach {#sec-UTh-AnalyticalChoices}

Considerations for choice of instrumentation and analytical method
e.g., Advantages and disadvantages for TIMS vs MC ICPMS
FAR-FAR vs. ion counter
types of ion counters
