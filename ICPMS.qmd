Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry 

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a rapidly growing technique as some type of ICP-MS instrumentation is found in most geochemistry labs. Advantages of ICP include (1) high ionization efficiency, (2) rapid sample throughout, and (3) the ability to measure solids, liquids and gases using the same instrument. Disadvantages that must be overcome when using ICP-MS instrumentation include (1) loss of transmission efficiency during sample introduction, (2) the requirement of energy filtering and beam shaping due to the large energy range and transverse velocity of ions generated by the plasma, (3) differential pumping is required due to the source being open to atmosphere, and (4) mass overlaps, or isobaric interferences.

## Sample preparation {#Sec-Sample-preparation}

### Solution analysis

### Solid analysis

## Sample introduction for ICP-MS {#Sec-Sample-introduction-for-ICP-MS}
Because we can analyze solids, liquids, and gases, there are a lot of different sample introduction methods. 

### Solution analysis
Types of ICP Spray Chambers: (Kate will fill in details)

1. Scott type
2. High-efficiency
3. Cyclonic
4. Desolvating

Types of ICP Nebulizers: (Kate will fill in details)

1. Concentric pneumatic
2. Cross-flow pneumatic
3. Ultrasonic (high sensitivity)
4. High-solids (V-groove, Babington)

### Solids
crushed and picked (and/or mineral sep) vs in situ

### Gases
some things travel in the gaseous phase when they're introduced. For instance, mercury, sulfur

## Inductively Coupled Plasma
how a plasma is generated

### Plasma types
Ar plasmas are the most common
Links to other types of plasmas (i.e., Ne, N) 

### Plasma state
The plasma can exist at a range of temperatures, controlled by gas flows and RF
Those choices are made based on the type of analyses and/or the sample introduction system

## The interface
The interface is like the vestibule of the ICP-MS. You have to get through the door, take off your shoes, hang up your coat. 
This is where we're moving toward higher vacuum, getting the ions into the instrument

Schematic of the interface region (cones + whatever for different types of instruments). Have pictures of the parts too
torch
>quartz or ceramic
guard electrode - some steel, some platinum
bonnet - the purpose of the bonnet is to try to limit the amount of atmospheric gases that you are drawing into your ICP

Cones - all differnt types of cones

Ion Extraction Lenses

>low vs high voltage extraction - is this where we introduce the concept of quads vs multicollectors? 

## Ion optics
Now we have an ion beam, and we are steering and shaping

>appertures and defining slits

>lenses

>steering plates

>Wien filters

## Ion separation

### Collision/reaction cells

### Quadrupoles

### Magnets

### ESAs

### Tandem mass spectrometry

### TOF

## Ion detection

different detector types

quadrupoles/TOFs have SEMs (with pulse and analog modes)

Sector field instruments - all the options

## Environmental considerations
It's really important to control the temperature and humidity of the room because you're going from atmospheric pressure into a high vacuum environment

## Examples of ICP Mass Spectrometers

### Quads

### TOFs

### Magnetic sectors

### Tandem (MS/MS) machines
